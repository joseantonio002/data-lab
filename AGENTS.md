# Data-lab

This is a repo where I store programming assignments from my master's in data engineering. Each directorie in the base directorie is a course and inside are the assignments

For each assignment I want to create a README file that explains:
 - Start with a clear summary/goal section that highlights the problem space and deliverables.
 - List the supporting files so reviewers know where to look for evidence of your work.
 - Explain the runtime environment (Docker, scripts, tools) and why it is configured that way.
 - Dedicate a section to the specific technologies that prove your skills.
 - Close with a lessons-learned paragraph.
