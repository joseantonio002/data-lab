Programming assignments from my master's in data engineering


## TO-DO

1. For each project, add requirements and description

 - Start with a clear summary/goal section that highlights the problem space and deliverables.
 - List the supporting files so reviewers know where to look for evidence of your work.
 - Explain the runtime environment (Docker, scripts, tools) and why it is configured that way.
 - Dedicate a section to the specific SQL techniques or other technologies that prove your skills.
 - Close with a lessons-learned paragraph that focuses on impact (reproducibility, scalability, quality).
